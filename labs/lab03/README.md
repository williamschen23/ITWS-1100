Honestly flex-box and dealing with fixed position was very annoying. I will have to learn how to do these better in the future. Additionally, this project started with template.js, templating the header and footer. However, I quickly learned that I needed the href links to change because this is not one file, which just destroyed the usage of template code to my knowledge. However, in the future if I discover a way to use it, then I will be using templates instead of copy and pasting the same code. A lot of this project was also done inside of flexbox, with a better structure than the resume. There are still many things that I want to make gradual changes to, but this is it for now.
