I checked the length of the document without any margins.
I made this to look similar to my current resume, I have to edit it more to reflect more about what I am currently working.

Some of the more interesting things I have noticed:

For separate divs, p:first-child referenced each of the first p tags in the divs
Cant nest ul's, had to put a ul inside of a li 
To put two things on the same line, you can justify a space in between two flexbox elements
I need to learn more about how to manipulate margin and padding because resume didn't really teach that
